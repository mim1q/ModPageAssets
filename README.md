# Mim1q's Minecraft Mod Project Page Assets

Here you can find my badges, section headers etc. in markdown format.

## Terms of use

You can use them in any of your projects on the condition that you credit me as their author, as well as provide a link to one of my pages, depending on where you use the graphics:

- CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/members/mim1q/projects
- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/user/mim1q
- Anywhere else: https://github.com/mim1q

The notice can be placed, for example, at the bottom of your project's description, using the following markdown code:

```markdown
Badges and section headers created by [Mim1q](https://github.com/mim1q)
```

The result should look like this:

> Badges and section headers created by [Mim1q](https://github.com/mim1q)

## How to use

Head to the [`badges`](https://github.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/tree/main/badges), [`sections`](https://github.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/tree/main/sections) or [`separators`](https://github.com/mim1q/ModPageAssets/tree/main/separators) directory. There, you will find a `README.md` file containing all of the usable graphics.

To use a badge, copy the markdown code provided below it and paste it to your project's description (make sure that your project makes use of markdown formatting).
